# Gunjal & Sons E-commerce Cloth Store

Welcome to Gunjal & Sons, a fully responsive fictitious e-commerce website.

This project showcases a fully functional frontend for an online store. While currently it operates as a standalone application, the intention is to integrate to enable real functionality, including user authentication and order placement.

Features:

Responsive design for optimal viewing across devices.
Seamless browsing and shopping experience.
Placeholder account section for future integration with user authentication and registration.
Please note that the current version does not support user login or registration.

Stay tuned for updates as we work towards making Gunjal & Sons a fully operational e-commerce platform.
